This is for [TheOdinProject Webdevelopment 101 HTML/CSS mini project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
Goal is making a Google-Homepage mockup to test html/css knowledge which doesnt go anywhere.

After project thoughts:

!!alwas reset the css!!
had trouble making the footer touch the edges.


Had to look up a lot of commands
especially for positioning.

    text-align: center;
    vertical-align: middle;

 are lifesavers

 absolute centering came in handy:

    position: absolute;
    top: 30%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    max-width:50%;
    height:250px;

but most importantly actual google came in handy for finding out how to do things, but it made me feel like i need a lot of assistance.
